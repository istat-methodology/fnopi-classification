# FNOPI Classification
This repository contains the code and resources for the FNOPI (Federazione Nazionale degli Ordini delle Professioni Infermieristiche) Classification project, developed by the Methodology team at ISTAT. The goal of this project is to classify and categorize nursing-related documents using NLP models, clustering and semantic search.

## Project Description
The FNOPI Classification project provides tools and scripts to:

- Preprocess text data related to nursing and healthcare professions.

- Apply models to assign codes to documents and to create clusters from documents.

## Repository Structure
Here’s an overview of the repository’s main components:

### 📁 classifications
Contains classification files, such as `NIC_classification.csv`, that map nursing interventions or services to NIC categories.

### 📁 csv
Includes CSV files with cleaned and preprocessed data, such as:

- N_prestazioni_by_note_infermieristiche.csv – number of nursing interventions by notes
- N_prestazioni_by_macroprestazione.csv - number of nursing interventions by text of macro catoegory of intervention
- N_prestazioni_by_cod_valoremedio_liquidazione.csv - number of nursing interventions by code of average value of settlement
- berttopic_frequencies_61_topic_15052025 - Categories generated by the topic modeling algorithm (to be assessed and improved).
- other intermediate data used for classification tasksk

### 📁 dataset
Holds datasets of nursing-related contents and the preprocessed version of the same dataset, e.g., df_prestazioni_inf_clean.csv, to be used for elaborations

### 📁 documents
Contains reference documents, such as Elenco NIC.docx listing classification codes or descriptions.

### 📁 html
Stores generated HTML files (e.g., visualizations, reports).

### 📁 img
Includes images like topic word clouds and other visualizations.
