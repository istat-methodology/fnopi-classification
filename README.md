# FNOPI Classification
This repository contains the code and resources for the FNOPI (Federazione Nazionale degli Ordini delle Professioni Infermieristiche) Classification project, developed by the Methodology team at ISTAT. The goal of this project is to classify and categorize nursing-related documents using NLP models, clustering and semantic search.

## Project Description
The FNOPI Classification project provides tools and scripts to:

- Preprocess text data related to nursing and healthcare professions.

- Apply models to assign codes to documents and to create clsuters from documents.

This work is part of the broader ISTAT efforts to support statistical analysis in the healthcare sector, improving the understanding of nursing professions and their distribution across Italy.
