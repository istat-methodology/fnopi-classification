Classification of nursing notes (FNOPI) using NLP models, clustering, and semantic search


# FNOPI Classification
This repository contains the code and resources for the FNOPI (Federazione Nazionale degli Ordini delle Professioni Infermieristiche) Classification project, developed by the Methodology team at ISTAT. The goal of this project is to classify and categorize nursing-related documents using NLP models, clustering and semantic search.

# Project Description
The FNOPI Classification project provides tools and scripts to:

- Preprocess text data related to nursing and healthcare professions.

- Apply classification models to assign FNOPI codes to documents.

- Support statistical analysis and reporting based on FNOPI classification.

This work is part of the broader ISTAT efforts to support statistical analysis in the healthcare sector, improving the understanding of nursing professions and their distribution across Italy.

# Features
- Preprocessing Pipeline: Clean and normalize raw text data.

- Classification Model: Assign FNOPI codes using machine learning or rule-based methods.

- Evaluation: Tools for model performance assessment.

- Utilities: Support functions for data exploration, visualization, and export.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/istat-methodology/fnopi-classification.git
cd fnopi-classification

Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Instructions for running the classification scripts:

python classify.py --input data/input_file.csv --output results/output_file.csv

Example notebooks and scripts demonstrate the workflow for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
